# SBOM 

This repository contains a variant of the original SwiftBOM demo tool supporting enhanced SPDX component input.

A "Software Bill of Materials" (SBOM) is effectively a nested inventory, a list of ingredients that make up software components.  You can learn more about SBOM at [https://www.ntia.gov/sbom](https://www.ntia.gov/sbom). There are several links to community developed documents in the NTIA's website.

SwiftBOM a SBOM generator tool [here](./SwiftBOM/) is part of CERT's work in supporting SBOM generation efforts for Proof-of-Concepts and Demo purposes.  This tool is currently being explored by  [Healthcare Proof of Concept](https://www.ntia.gov/files/ntia/publications/ntia_sbom_healthcare_poc_report_2019_1001.pdf) teams for their PoC efforts. 

To start SwiftBOM either download the sources or run it via the following link SwiftBOM](https://hansbusch.github.io/SwiftBOM/SwiftBOM/).  

## Import restrictions

### Tagged SPDX format
* Support for importing one or multiple files with automatic reference solving based on SPDXIDs. 
* Output is restricted to supported tags. Any additional tags are discarded on export.
* In case input doesn't include SPDXID entries these will be filled with GUID values.
* Relationship support restricted to 'CONTAINS' and 'DEPENDS_ON'.
* The UI can only show a single parent per component. If multiple exist only one will be shown.
* No support for file level information beyond package file names and their checksums.

### NPM
* Creator field not filled automatically.
### PIP
* Creator and supplier fields not filled automatically.
### Excel
* Not supported.

# SBOM Output Formats  

SwiftBOM currently generates SBOM in [SPDX](https://spdx.dev/), [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/) [SWID](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/Software-Identification-SWID) formats. A tree graph is also generated by SwiftBOM that can be downloaded as a PNG file to quickly visualize relationships between components in an SBOM.  Currently the tool uses CONTAINS as the default relationship mode (SWID Relationships)[https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/7-relationships-between-SPDX-elements/#71-relationship]. A generated SBOM in all three formats is currently a standalone document and does not support external relationships.
